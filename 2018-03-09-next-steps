Tasks may work:

1. generate 3d-voxels or imigrate dicoms to json for the ease of oberavations. Note that sometimes it is handy when we want to print all datas in a console. 
That is almost impossible.

2. write some algorithms to modify the voxels, based on the obsevations you do previously and afterward.

3. search on line for the 3d cluster algorithms

4. if find one, then learn how to 3d- rebuild and visualize the result.

That is all.
